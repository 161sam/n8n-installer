# Guidance for Codex Agents

This repository contains the **n8n-installer** – a Docker Compose based stack that bundles n8n, Flowise, Open WebUI and many other services.  Codex agents may create or modify workflows, Python scripts or shell utilities to extend the setup.

## General Tips
- All services are configured via `.env` which is generated by `scripts/03_generate_secrets.sh`.  **Never commit the generated `.env` file or any credentials.**
- Most services are accessed through sub‑domains such as `n8n.yourdomain.com` or `flowise.yourdomain.com`.  When editing configuration files make sure to adjust these placeholders to the correct domain.
- After installation users should change all default passwords.  Remind them if your changes touch login data.

## Typical Agent Tasks
- Add or improve n8n workflows (`n8n-tool-workflows/` or `n8n/backup/`)
- Extend Python helpers such as `n8n_pipe.py` or `start_services.py`
- Tweak Docker compose services or shell scripts in `scripts/`
- Update documentation inside `ai-docs/` or other markdown files

## Testing
If the project contains automated tests, run:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```
Additionally verify that the update routine works:
```bash
bash ./scripts/update.sh
```
The update script refreshes the `.env` and pulls containers.  It may fail in a restricted environment – mention this in your PR if it happens.
