# Guidance for Codex Agents (ai-docs/)

The `ai-docs` folder collects project documentation in Markdown.  Codex agents may update these files to keep them in sync with the code base.

- Use Markdown headings and lists where appropriate.
- Keep line length under 120 characters for readability.
- Link to other files in the repository when useful.
